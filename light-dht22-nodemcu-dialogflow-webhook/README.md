## General information
This source code was developed as a guide on how to setup of Flask web application that is connected to NodeMCU web server, and Dialogflow webhook.

## Hardware needed
* Raspberry Pi 3B+ (Compatible on Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W, Raspberry Pi B+, Raspberry Pi 2 B, Raspberry Pi 3 B, Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Raspberry Pi 3 A+)
* ReSpeaker 4-Mics Pi HAT
* Speaker with 3.5mm audio jack
* NodeMCU V3 development board
* Breadboard
* Relay Module
* Temperature and Humidity Sensor - DHT22
* Light Bulb
* Router (For WiFi Connection)

## Setup
For a detailed instruction on how to control a relay switch connected to a light bulb and read temperature with DHT22 sensor using NodeMCU, Dialogflow, webhook,flask, ngrok, HTTP Request, and Google Assistant together with Raspberry Pi and ReSpeaker 4-Mics Pi Hat, head on to this [blogpost](https://store.createlabz.com/blogs/createlabz-tutorials/respeaker-2-mics-pi-hat-with-raspberry-pi) .
